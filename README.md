# Quick Cash

Project Demo Link: 

## Overview

This repository contains the source code for **Quick Cash**, a Java-based mobile application developed as part of a group project for **CS3130: Introduction to Software Engineering**. The application was built using **Android Studio** with Java and follows key software engineering practices such as **Agile methodology**, **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**, and **Extreme Programming (XP)**.

**Quick Cash** serves as a platform where **employers can post jobs** and **users (employees) can browse and apply for jobs**. The app features a **smart filtering system** that enables users to search for jobs based on their **current location**, **keywords**, and **job category**.

For payment, the app integrates **PayPal** to simulate transactions between employers and employees. Additionally, **Google Firebase** is used to manage authentication, job data, and user information.

The development process was conducted over **three iterations**, each lasting 3â€“4 weeks. At the beginning of each iteration, the client provided a **story card** outlining the feature requirements. Our team then translated those into **user acceptance tests** and **engineering tasks**, with a strong focus on delivering functional solutions at every stage.

Using **TDD**, we wrote unit and UI tests before implementing new features to ensure code reliability. The project also adopted **CI/CD pipelines via GitLab**, where every code push had to pass build and test processes before being merged. On average, we committed code **2.5 times daily**, enabling rapid and continuous development. Furthermore, the application design follows **SOLID principles** and utilizes appropriate **design patterns** to enhance code maintainability.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Sign up and log in as an employer or employee. Credentials are securely managed via Firebase Authentication.
- **Job Posting**: Employers can create job posts including title, category, salary, description, and location. New job listings appear on the main dashboard.
- **Job Application**: Employees can apply to one or multiple job posts. Once accepted, the job status changes to "To-Do" until marked as completed by the employee.
- **Applicant Management**: Employers can view a list of applicants for each job and accept suitable candidates.
- **Payment Integration**: Once a job is completed, the employer is directed to PayPal to process the payment. Upon completion, the job status is updated to "Completed."
- **Advanced Filtering**: Users can filter job listings based on location, keywords, or job category for a more targeted search.
